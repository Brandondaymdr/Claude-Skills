## 2. Menu Strategy for Cafes & Bars

### Cafe-Specific Tips
- **Modifier groups are your friend** — Create modifier groups for milk types (whole, oat, almond, soy), sizes (small/medium/large), add-ons (extra shot, flavor syrups), and temperature (hot/iced)
- **Quick Order screen** — Configure your top 10-15 items on the Quick Order screen for speed during morning rush
- **Seasonal menus** — Use time-based menu visibility to rotate seasonal specials without deleting items
- **Retail items** — If selling bags of beans, pastries to go, or merchandise, use Toast's retail features (Menu Management > set item as retail)

### Bar-Specific Tips
- **Tab management** — Train bartenders to pre-authorize cards and use the "Hold Card" feature
- **Happy Hour setup** — Create a separate Happy Hour menu with discounted prices, set availability to specific days/times
- **Drink modifiers** — Build modifier groups for: garnishes, preparation method (shaken/stirred), spirit upgrades (well to top-shelf)
- **Late-night menu** — Set a separate menu that activates after kitchen closes (bar snacks only)
- **Quick pour buttons** — Set up Quick Order with your most popular cocktails, beers, and wines

### Pricing Strategy
- Use **Size Pricing** for items that come in multiple sizes at different prices
- Use **Modifier Price Adjustments** for upcharges (e.g., +$2 for oat milk, +$3 for premium spirit)
- Set up **Combo/Bundle pricing** for meal deals or drink specials
- Configure **Automatic discounts** for promotions (e.g., 20% off appetizers 4-6pm)

## 3. Staff Management Best Practices

### Permission Levels to Configure
- **Bartender/Server**: Take orders, open/close tabs, process payments, view own sales
- **Shift Lead**: Above + void items, apply comps/discounts, access cash drawer
- **Manager**: Above + view all reports, edit employee schedules, manage 86'd items
- **Owner/Admin**: Full Toast Web access, all settings, financial reports

### Tip Configuration
- **Individual tips**: Each server/bartender keeps their own tips
- **Tip pooling**: Pool tips across all tipped employees, distribute by hours worked or by role
- **Tip-out**: Servers tip out a percentage to bussers, barbacks, hosts
- Configure in Toast Web: **Employees > Tips**

### Labor Cost Control
- Monitor the **labor-to-sales ratio** in real-time through reporting
- Target: 25-35% for full-service, 20-30% for counter-service cafes
- Use scheduling to match staffing to historical sales patterns by hour
- Review **Hourly Sales report** to identify when you're over- or under-staffed

## 4. Financial Controls

### Preventing Loss
- Require **manager approval for voids** after items are sent to kitchen
- Set **discount limits** by employee role
- Review the **Void Report** daily — look for patterns
- Use the **Cash Management** reports to catch discrepancies
- Enable **blind cash drops** so employees count without seeing the expected amount

### Key Reports to Review Weekly
- **Sales Summary**: Total revenue, check count, average check
- **Product Mix**: Which items drive revenue vs. which are slow movers
- **Discount Report**: Are comps/discounts within acceptable range? (Target: under 3% of sales)
- **Void Report**: Frequency, reasons, and which employees
- **Labor Summary**: Total labor cost as % of sales

### End-of-Month Reconciliation
- Export sales data from Toast Reporting
- Compare against bank deposits
- Reconcile credit card processing fees
- Review service charge collection vs. payout
- Verify tax collected matches tax remittance

## 5. Online Ordering Optimization

### Setup Checklist
- Configure online ordering hours (can differ from dine-in hours)
- Set realistic **prep time estimates** — underpromise, overdeliver
- Enable **order throttling** during peak hours to avoid overwhelming kitchen
- Curate your online menu — not everything on your dine-in menu needs to be online
- Add item descriptions and photos for online items
- Set up **delivery zones** and fees if offering delivery

### Maximizing Online Revenue
- Feature high-margin items prominently
- Use **upsell modifiers** (add a pastry? extra shot?)
- Enable **scheduled orders** for catering/large orders
- Promote online ordering through in-store signage and social media

## 6. Guest Experience & Loyalty

### Building Your Guest Database
- Encourage online ordering (captures email/phone automatically)
- Use Toast's **guest-facing display** to collect email at checkout
- Run occasional promotions requiring email signup

### Loyalty Program Strategy
- **Points-based**: Earn 1 point per dollar, redeem at thresholds (e.g., 100 points = $10 off)
- **Visit-based**: Every 10th visit, get a free drink
- Promote loyalty sign-ups at the register and online
- Use loyalty data to identify your VIP customers and their preferences

### Email Marketing
- Send weekly or bi-weekly emails with specials, events, new menu items
- Segment by: loyal customers, lapsed customers, online orderers
- Use Toast's built-in email marketing or export guest data to your preferred platform
